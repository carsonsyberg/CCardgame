The suits are ranked Spade Club Diamond Heart

The objective of the game is to get rid of all of 
	your cards before anyone else

The player who has the lowest card in the game (three 
	of spades) goes first and can play any combination 
	as long as it contains the three of spades

After the three of spades is played by player 1 player 2 goes

Combinations:

Singles - single card, can be beaten by a card of a 
	  higher value or a card of the same value 
          with a higher ranked suit

Double - two of the same value, can be beaten by a 
	 pair of a higher value or a pair of the 
         same value with one higher ranked suit

Triple - three of the same value, can only be 
	 beaten by a triple of higher value

Run - combination of at least three cards that  
      are in numerical order (2s cannot be included in runs)

Breakers (can beat a 2 if the player has not passed yet)

	4 of a kind
	A run of pairs (33, 44, 55)

A player can pass if they wish to but then they will 
	not get to play until the turn is reset

If no one can beat the cards that were played 
	then the last person who played gets to reset 
	(change what is being played to anything they want)

If a player cannot play they automatically pass
